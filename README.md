# Digital Clock

A simple and elegant digital clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project displays the current time in the format of **Hours:Minutes:Seconds** and updates dynamically every second. The design features a visually appealing gradient background and responsive styling.

## Features

- **Dynamic Time Display**: Updates the clock every second to show the current time.
- **Stylish Design**: Features a gradient background and a semi-transparent clock container with a blur effect for a modern look.
- **Responsive Layout**: The design is centered on the screen and adapts well to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the digital clock.
- **CSS**: Styling for the clock and background.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to dynamically update the time every second.

## How It Works

1. The clock uses the JavaScript `Date` object to retrieve the current time.
2. The `setInterval` method is used to update the time every second.
3. The time is displayed in a formatted manner with leading zeros for single-digit values.
4. CSS provides the visual styling, including a gradient background, a glass-like clock container, and stylish labels.
